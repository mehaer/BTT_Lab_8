This project uses a Decision Tree Regressor to predict the Life Ladder score, a measure of subjective well-being, based on socioeconomic and emotional factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and more. The model is trained using supervised learning, with emphasis on interpretability through feature importance analysis. Data preprocessing includes removing null values and features highly correlated with the target. Model performance is evaluated using RÂ² and RMSE metrics, with plans for further improvement via hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods.
